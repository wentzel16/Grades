# Grades

The idea is to familiarize ourselves with php, Laravel and to deploy a website.
We will first draft the layout for the page.
User will be able to sign in
User will be able to see a history of their semesters
User will be able to delete a semester (all inclusive)
User will be able to update a semester (all inclusive)
User will be able to enter a course with all of itÂ´s projects and the weight for each course.
User will be able to enter their grades and the system will calculate the status, how much to you need to pass if you get a 5 in

And more....
